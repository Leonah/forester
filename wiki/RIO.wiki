#summary resampled inference of orthologs

= RIO: Resampled Inference of Orthologs =

== Purpose ==

RIO (Resampled Inference of Orthologs) is a method for automated phylogenomics based on explicit phylogenetic inference. RIO analyses are performed over resampled phylogenetic trees to estimate the reliability of orthology assignments.


== Usage == 
{{{
java -Xmx2048m -cp forester.jar org.forester.application.rio [options] <gene trees> <species tree> <outfile> [logfile]
}}}

=== Options ===

  * -b : to use SDIR instead of GSDIR (faster, but non-binary species trees are disallowed) 

  
==== Gene trees ====
The gene trees ideally are in [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/356/ phyloXML] format, with taxonomy and sequence data in appropriate fields; but can also be in New Hamphshire (Newick) or Nexus format, as long as species information can be extracted from the gene names (e.g. "HUMAN" from "BCL2_HUMAN") ([http://forester.googlecode.com/files/gene_trees_rio.nh example]).
All gene trees must be *completely binary*.


==== Species tree ====
Must be in [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/356/ phyloXML] format ([http://forester.googlecode.com/files/species_tree_rio.xml example]). 
The species tree is allowed to have nodes with more than two descendents (polytomies) as long as GSDIR ([GSDI GSDI] re-rooting) algorithm is used. 


=== Example ===
`rio gene_trees.nh species.xml outtable.tsv log.txt`

  * [http://forester.googlecode.com/files/species_tree_rio.xml species tree file]
